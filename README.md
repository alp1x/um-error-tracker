# ðŸš§ um-error-tracker
Most of you are missing errors due to too many stream files at server startup and sometimes confused what exactly is not working, so I made a small tool that monitors the (server-side) console, it takes the entire console from the time the server is started and monitors it instantly

## Usage
* first download from [here](#) **[not source!]**
* ``server.cfg > ensure um-error-tracker``
* command: ``/errortracker``

## Development
``cd um-error-tracker``

``cd web``

``pnpm i``

``pnpm run build --watch``



## Requirements
[ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib/releases/latest)
